##### 7.3.3 (beta)
* Another major internal update! Completly reworked the internal system for representing item data.
  * The previous system, although more memory efficient, suffered from many problems. It would easly break with updates of the game. It required constant re-specification, making developing and maintaining plugins for other developers much harder.
  * More importantly, the previous system was designed before the advent of Guild Banks. These were considered a set of bags controlled by the player character, which led to a whole set of issues. In the new system, this is no longer the case.
* Visible changes:
  * Guilds are now considered independent entities from player characters, and the Guild Bank is owned by the Guild.
  * Due to the above, issues from having multiple characters on the same guild are now fixed.
  * Guilds your characters belong to are now listed in the _onwer_ selection dropdown. Selecting them will open the Guild Bank of that Guild.
